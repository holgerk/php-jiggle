Jiggle is a depency injection container for php 5.3+

## Examples

<!-- START AUTOGENERATED EXAMPLES -->
### Set and get dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Lazy loading with factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = function() {
    return 42;
};
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Simple wiring of dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Magic injection of depencies into factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function($d1) {
    return $d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Simple instantiation
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return new D3($jiggle->d1, $jiggle->d2);
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Instantiation with magic constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->create('D3');
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Short form of magic constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = $jiggle->createFactory('D3');
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```
