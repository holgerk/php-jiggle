# php-jiggle [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/holgerk/jiggle/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/holgerk/jiggle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holgerk/php-jiggle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holgerk/php-jiggle)

Jiggle is a depency injection container for php 5.3+

By default every dependency is a singleton.
If you assign an function to to the container it is considered as an singleton factory.
So the function is only called once when the dependency is required the first time.

## Examples

<!-- START AUTOGENERATED EXAMPLES -->
### Set and get dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Lazy loading with factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = function() {
    return 42;
};
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Basic wiring of dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Implicit injection of depencies into singleton factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function($d1) {
    return $d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Explicit injection of depencies into any function
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$result = $jiggle->inject(function($d1, $d2) {
    return $d1 + $d2;
});
echo $result; // => 42
```

### Explicit injection with dependency overloading
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 20;
$jiggle->d2 = 1000;
$result = $jiggle->inject(function($d1, $d2, $d3) {
    return $d1 + $d2 + $d3;
}, array('d2' => 20, 'd3' => 2));
echo $result; // => 42
```

### Basic instantiation
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return new D3($jiggle->d1, $jiggle->d2);
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Instantiation with implicit constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->create('D3');
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Short form of implicit constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = $jiggle->singleton('D3');
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Basic function dependency
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = function() {
    return function() {
        return 42;
    };
};
echo $jiggle->d1(); // => 42
```

### Existing deps could not replaced by accident
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->a = true;
$jiggle->a = false; // <- throws an exception
```

### Existing deps could be replaced implicitly
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 21;
$jiggle->replace('d1', 42);
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Isset support
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$this->assertTrue(isset($jiggle->d1));
$this->assertFalse(isset($jiggle->d2));
```
