# php-jiggle [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/holgerk/jiggle/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/holgerk/jiggle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holgerk/php-jiggle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holgerk/php-jiggle)

Jiggle is a depency injection container for php 5.3+

By default every dependency is a singleton.
If you assign an function to to the container it is considered as an singleton factory.
So the function is only called once when the dependency is required the first time.

## Methods

<!-- START AUTOGENERATED METHODS -->
### singleton($class)
Create a singleton factory for the given class

 * **param** string $class the class which should be instantiated
 * **return** callable

### create($class)
Create an object of the given class

If the class constructor has arguments they are injected from the current jiggle instance.

 * **param** string $class the class to instantiate
 * **return** object the newly created instance

### inject($callable, $overloadedDeps = array())
Executes the given callable

If the callable has arguments they are injected from the current jiggle instance.

 * **param** callable $callable the callable to invoke
 * **param** array $overloadedDeps optional additional or overloaded dependencies
 * **return** mixed return value of the invoked callable

### replace($name, $value)
Replace an existing dependency

Usefull if one would like to mock some part of a bigger system or for clients to replace an
unwanted implementation.

 * **param** string $name  of the dependency to replace
 * **param** mixed  $value replacement implementation

### resolver($callable)
Let one provide a callable which is called if a dependency is not resolvable

If the provided resolver can resolve the dependency it should simply return it.
If the dependency could not resolved the resolver needs to throw an exception,
otherwise the dependency would be resolved to null.

 * **param** callable $callable the resolver callabe

## Examples

<!-- START AUTOGENERATED EXAMPLES -->
### Set and get dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Lazy loading with factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = function() {
    return 42;
};
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Basic wiring of dependencies
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Implicit injection of depencies into singleton factory functions
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$jiggle->d2 = function($d1) {
    return $d1;
};
echo $jiggle->d2; // => 42
```

### Explicit injection of depencies into any function
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$result = $jiggle->inject(function($d1, $d2) {
    return $d1 + $d2;
});
echo $result; // => 42
```

### Explicit injection with dependency overloading
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 20;
$jiggle->d2 = 1000;
$result = $jiggle->inject(function($d1, $d2, $d3) {
    return $d1 + $d2 + $d3;
}, array('d2' => 20, 'd3' => 2));
echo $result; // => 42
```

### Basic instantiation
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return new D3($jiggle->d1, $jiggle->d2);
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Instantiation with implicit constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = function() use($jiggle) {
    return $jiggle->create('D3');
};
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Short form of implicit constructor injection
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 40;
$jiggle->d2 = 2;
$jiggle->d3 = $jiggle->singleton('D3');
echo $jiggle->d3->sum(); // => 42
```

### Basic function dependency
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = function() {
    return function() {
        return 42;
    };
};
echo $jiggle->d1(); // => 42
```

### Existing deps could not replaced by accident
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->a = true;
$jiggle->a = false; // <- throws an exception
```

### Existing deps could be replaced implicitly
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 21;
$jiggle->replace('d1', 42);
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```

### Isset support
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->d1 = 42;
$this->assertTrue(isset($jiggle->d1));
$this->assertFalse(isset($jiggle->d2));
```

### Resolver is called for unresolvable deps
```php
$jiggle = new Jiggle;
$jiggle->resolver(function($dependencyName) {
    if ($dependencyName == 'd2') {
        return 42;
    }
    throw new Exception("Could not resolve dependency: $dependencyName!");
});
$jiggle->d1 = function($d2) { return $d2; };
echo $jiggle->d1; // => 42
```
